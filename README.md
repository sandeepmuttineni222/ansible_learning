## Introduction to Ansible

Ansible is a simple, agentless, and powerful automation tool. It uses **SSH** to communicate with remote servers and execute tasks, making it an ideal choice for managing large numbers of systems. It is used for:

- **Configuration management**
- **Application deployment**
- **Automating repetitive tasks**

Key features:
- Simple YAML syntax (Human-readable)
- Agentless architecture
- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin using Ansible, ensure you have the following:

- A basic understanding of Linux/Unix commands
- Access to a machine where you can install Ansible
- SSH access to remote machines (for Ansible to manage them)

## Setting Up Ansible

### 1. Install Ansible

You can install Ansible on most Linux distributions. Hereâ€™s an example for **Ubuntu**:
